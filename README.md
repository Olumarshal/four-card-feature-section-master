### What I learned

Some CSS codes i'm really proud of

grid-template-areas:
    "one"
    "two"
    "three"
    "four";

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on the Grid layout system and understanding it better and also getting  comfortable working with cards.



### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me understand the Grid layout pattern and i look forward to using it in the future.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Media_objects) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid template areas. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
